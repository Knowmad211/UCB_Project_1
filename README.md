# UCB_Project_1

Dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset

*COVID Data is accurate up to Feb, 2021.
For this project we're looking at the malnourishment (obesity and undernourishment) rates and their relationshiip with the number COVID-19 cases/death rates.
Through our analysis we saw that the p-values and the r-squared values were low and that there was no significant correlation between these variables. 
And that further research on these variables needs to be conducted to understand the dynamics at play.

The raw dataset that we got from the webpage mentioned above, is all located under the directory Raw Data. 
It contains 5 csv files which we read into our final code file UCB_Project1_Final.ipynb.
This file contains all of our code for the reading, cleaning of the dataset and also the code for the different graphs/plots we created.
